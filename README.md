# MemoryBenchmark
Modified Object-Oriented version of renowned STREAM benchmark.
This version is only for Windows OS. I plan to update my bench-
mark further with additional classes covering dynamic allocation
by the operator new and by _mm_malloc.

Work in progress on benchmark test runner classes.
